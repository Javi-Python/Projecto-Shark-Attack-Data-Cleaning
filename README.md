# Projecto-Shark-Attack-Data-Cleaning

This project was about trying to find insights in a terribly dirty data frame.

To do this, I created some functions and used regex to try and salvage what ever data was valuable to in order to find some insights, and to visualize it.

The hypothesis I tried to answer was what would be the most likely target for a fatal shark attack, as well as understandd what the deadliest species was

I hope you enjoy it
