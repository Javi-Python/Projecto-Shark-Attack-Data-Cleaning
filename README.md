# Projecto-Shark-Attack-Data-Cleaning

This project was about trying to find insights in a terribly dirty data frame.

To do this, I created some functions and used regex to try and salvage what ever data was valuable to in order to find some insights, and to visualize it.

The Questions I tried to answer where:

- Who makes the most likely target for a fatal shark attack?
- What is the deadliest shark species?

The project consists of:
1. Cleaning Shark Data V1 -- A jupyter notebook with the data cleaning & data wranggling I used to solve my hypothesis
2. Shark Attack Hypothesis Testing & Visualization -- A jupyter notebook that consists of me preparing and plotting the answers to my hypothesis
3. Shark Story Time -- A jupyter notebook that sumarizes insights from the data
4. Data -- A folder containing the intial CSV as well as the cleaned version I worked with
5. Images - A folder containing images of the plots
6. SRC -- A folder containing a python file with the functions I will be using for data cleaning and visualizing

I hope you enjoy it :)
